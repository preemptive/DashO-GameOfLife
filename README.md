# DashO-GameOfLife

A sample Android app that demonstrates using DashO with Libraries and Build Flavors.

This sample has four Build Flavors (`menu`, `single`, `withInteraction`, and `withoutInteraction`) and two Flavor Dimensions (`view` and `interactive`) creating four different applications:

* menuWithInteraction - Launches with a menu of three interactive views.
* menuWithoutInteraction - Launches with a menu of three non-interactive views.
* singleWithInteraction - Launches an interactive view.
* singleWithoutInteraction - Launches a non-interactive view.
